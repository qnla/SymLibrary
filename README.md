# SymLibrary_Public

This repository contains the MatLab code which allows mainipulation of tensors and tensor networks with on-site symmetries, including anyonic tensors and tensor networks. Documentation and test code to demonstrate accuracy of the code is upcoming however in the spirit of open source code the current code (which has been used by me on prior work) has been made publically avaliable.
